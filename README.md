==================
This is an archive of my old website which was created as a home for my youtube channel in 2015; the code is obviously very sloppy and unorganized because it was one of the first things I ever programmed. Despite that, I leave it here for archival purposes. 
As time went on I also began hosting some of my programming projects on the website but these were never publically linked.
The website is down now and I have begun using osullivanjam.es as my primary website.
